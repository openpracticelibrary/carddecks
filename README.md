# carddecks
This repository includes working and printing materials used to edit and print card decks for the Open Practice Library. It includes the print ready as well as editable files for cards, tuck box and leaflet insert. The files are organized in the directories working_files and print_ready_files. If you simply want to print the decks, please use the versions in print_ready_files in contact with your printer - these Adobe Illustrator files have been prepared for printing with the text converted to outlines. If you want to edit the files it is better to use the copies in working_files, where the Adobe Illustrator files have editable text.



# Updating card files
You will need Adobe Illustrator (or similar) with license to edit the files and customise the content. Please make sure to follow the below process when making any changes:
1. Always edit the file "working_files/cards - layout.ai"
2. When you're done editing, save the file.
3. Select all objects and convert all text to outlines (Menu Type / Create Outlines). NB! Do NOT save the file at this point!
4. Choose Menu File / Save As... to save the file as a copy in the print_ready_files directory. Name the file "cards - layout - print - v.X.Y.ai", where "X.Y" is the next version. For smaller changes, just increment the Y by one, for larger changes, increment X and reset Y to 0. For minor changes outside the actual product files (e.g. small changes in the readme file), just add a Z-version number, e.g. 3.4.1.
5. Convert the print ready .ai file to pdf and also save it in the print_ready_files directory, with the same name except for the .pdf suffix.
7. Update README.md with the correct version number and replace the "changes since last version" with a clear description of what you changed.
6. Commit and push your change and issue a Pull Request.
